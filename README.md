# Data Engineering Pipeline Overview
What is This Project?
This project creates a streamlined process for managing data. It takes information from a CSV file and organizes it into a database, making it easier to analyze and use.

# Key Features
Automated Data Handling: Converts data from a simple CSV file into a structured database format.
Error Logging: Alerts are generated if there are any issues with the data file or database access.

# How It Works
Extract Data: The system reads information from a CSV file (like an Excel spreadsheet).
Load Data: The data is then stored in a database, which is a more organized way to handle large amounts of information.

# Benefits
Efficiency: Automates the process of moving data from a file into a database.
Organization: Keeps data well-structured and easy to access.
Reliability: Includes error checks to ensure data is handled correctly.

# How to Use It
Prepare Your Data: Ensure your data file is ready and located in the correct folder.
Run the Process: Start the pipeline to extract and load your data.

# Troubleshooting
Missing File: Ensure the data file is in the right location.
Database Issues: Verify that the database setup is correct and accessible.
